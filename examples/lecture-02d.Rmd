## Introduction
This notebook contains sample code for Lecture-02d - Structuring Notebooks.

## Dependencies
This notebook requires two packages - `ggplot2` and `dplyr`.

```{r load-packages}
# tidyverse packages
library(dplyr)       # cleaning data
library(ggplot2)     # plotting data
```

## Load Data
For this set of examples, we'll take the `mpg` data from the `ggplot2` package and assign it to a new object to work with:

```{r load-data}
autoData <- mpg
```

For the rest of the code, we'll reference `autoData` as a starting point.

## Part 1
Part 1 of the assignment involves cleaning data from the mpg data frame.

### Question 1
The first question asks to explore the structure of the `autoData` data:

```{r}
str(autoData)
```
